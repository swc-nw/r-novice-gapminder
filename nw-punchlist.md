## A few issue to discuss

- DE is unconvinced that we should a few of the newer packages that have
(IMHO) not yet passed the test of time. Several examples follow.

- packrat in `plan.md`: I would much rather talk about packaging, or maybe
tone the issue down to just `data/`  and `scripts/` subdirectories

- ProjectTemplate in `02-project-into.Rmd`: Not a big fan of the package

- Overall focus on too much (unconditional) Hadley-ism: eg `tidyr` in `xx-why-R.Rmd`

- On the other hand, `gapminder` is still read by csv when there is now a package.
      
## RM responses

- I agree. My concern is that suggesting all these packages creates
  and "all or nothing" appearance that is contrary to the spirit we're
  trying to foster. Very much agree with "data/" and "scripts/".

- Installing gapminder would be a good initial exercise when we start
  with R.
